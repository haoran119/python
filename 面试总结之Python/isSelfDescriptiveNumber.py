"""
A self-descriptive number is an integer n in given base b is b digits long in which each digit at position p (the most significant digit being at position 0 
and the least significant at position b â€“ 1) counts how many times a digit p is in n.

For example in base 10, 6210001000 is a self descriptive number.

Explanation :
It is 10 digit number in base 10.
It has 6 at the position 0 and there are six 0s in 6210001000.
It has 2 at the position 1 and there are two 1s in 6210001000.
It has 1 at the position 2 and there is one 2s in 6210001000.
It has 0 at the position 3 and there are zero 3s in 6210001000.
It has 0 at the position 4 and there are zero 4s in 6210001000.
It has 0 at the position 5 and there are zero 5s in 6210001000.
It has 1 at the position 6 and there is one 6 in 6210001000.
It has 0 at the position 7 and there are zero 7s in 6210001000.
It has 0 at the position 8 and there are zero 8s in 6210001000.
It has 0 at the position 9 and there are zero 9s in 6210001000.
